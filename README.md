## Introduction

Welcome to our analysis of professional League of Legends matches, where we explore over 15,000 rows of detailed in-game data. Our dataset captures key performance metrics for each match, including gold differences and kill counts for various roles (top, jungle, mid, bot, and support), as well as the final match outcome.

# Central Question

"Which role is most valuable in carrying a team to victory based on early game performance?"

This question matters because early game advantages—measured through metrics like gold difference at 10 minutes and early kills—often set the stage for the rest of the match. By identifying which role consistently secures a strong early advantage, we can provide insights that are valuable to coaches, recruiters, players, and fans who want to understand the dynamics behind winning matches.
